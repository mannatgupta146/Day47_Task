# Day 46 Task | Cohort 2.0  
This project is my **Day 46 Task**, where I built a **Double-Tap Heart Animation Effect** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

When the user **double-clicks the image**, a heart appears at the center, pops with a smooth scale-up animation, rotates slightly, and fades out — similar to the **Instagram double-tap like animation**.  
This task helped me practice **CSS transforms, custom cubic-bezier transitions, opacity control, and DOM event handling**.


## 📌 About the Day 46 Task  
Day 46 focused on building **micro-interactions** using JavaScript and CSS animations, including:

- Detecting double-click using `dblclick`  
- Applying smooth transitions using **cubic-bezier easing**  
- Controlling **opacity**, **scale**, and **rotation** dynamically  
- Using **absolute positioning** + `translate(-50%, -50%)` to perfectly center the heart  
- Sequencing animations using `setTimeout()`  
- Experimenting with UI gestures and feedback animations  

This task helped strengthen my understanding of **user interactions and aesthetic UI effects**.


## ✨ Task Description  

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ❤️ **Double-Tap Heart Effect** | Heart appears on image double-click with a smooth popping animation. |
| 🎬 **Custom Animation Flow** | Scale-up → rotate → fade-out transitions controlled via JavaScript. |
| 🎨 **Cubic-Bezier Timing** | Smooth and natural animation curve applied using custom easing. |
| 🔧 **DOM Event Handling** | Listens for `dblclick` on the image container. |
| 🎯 **Absolute Centering** | Heart stays perfectly centered using translate positioning. |
| 🖼️ **Background Clipped Heart** | Custom background clipped into the heart using `background-clip: text;`. |
| 🧭 **Smooth Transitioning** | All animations use `transition: all 0.4s cubic-bezier(...)`. |


## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure  
- **CSS** – Styling, transitions, cubic-bezier animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Double-click detection, animation triggers  
- **VS Code / Browser** – Development environment  


## 📖 Learning Outcome  
Through this task, I learned how to:

- Create animations using **transform + opacity**  
- Use **custom cubic-bezier curves**  
- Trigger animations with JavaScript events  
- Apply `background-clip` for stylish icon effects  
- Use `setTimeout()` to control animation steps  
- Build interactive UI micro-animations without libraries  

This task improved my understanding of **motion design** and **micro-interactions** in frontend development.


## 🌟 Acknowledgement  
This task helped me practice creating smooth UI animations and user interaction effects using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Thank you to Cohort 2.0 for the continuous learning journey.
